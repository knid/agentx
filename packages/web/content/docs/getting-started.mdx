# Getting Started

Get up and running with agentx in under a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Claude CLI** installed and authenticated (`claude --version`)
- A terminal (macOS or Linux)

## Install the CLI

Install agentx globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g agentx
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
agentx --version
agentx doctor
```

The `doctor` command checks that your environment is set up correctly.

## Install Your First Agent

Browse the registry for available agents:

```bash
agentx search email
```

Install an agent:

```bash
agentx install @agentx/gmail-agent
```

## Configure Secrets

Some agents need API tokens or credentials. Configure them interactively:

```bash
agentx configure gmail-agent
```

This will prompt you for each required secret. Secrets are encrypted and stored locally.

## Run an Agent

Run the agent with a prompt:

```bash
agentx run gmail-agent "summarize my unread emails from today"
```

For interactive mode (chat-style):

```bash
agentx run gmail-agent -i
```

## Pipe Input

You can pipe content into an agent:

```bash
cat report.csv | agentx run data-analyst "analyze this data"
```

## List Installed Agents

```bash
agentx list
```

## Update Agents

Update a specific agent:

```bash
agentx update gmail-agent
```

Update all installed agents:

```bash
agentx update --all
```

## Uninstall Agents

```bash
agentx uninstall gmail-agent
```
