# Getting Started

Get up and running with agentx in under a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Claude CLI** installed and authenticated (`claude --version`)
- A terminal (macOS or Linux)

## Install the CLI

Install agentx globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @knid/agentx
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
agentx --version
agentx doctor
```

The `doctor` command checks that your environment is set up correctly.

## Install Your First Agent

Browse the registry for available agents:

```bash
agentx search email
```

Install an agent:

```bash
agentx install @agentx/gmail-agent
```

## Configure Secrets

Some agents need API tokens or credentials. Configure them interactively:

```bash
agentx configure gmail-agent
```

This will prompt you for each required secret. Secrets are encrypted and stored locally.

## Run an Agent

Run the agent with a prompt:

```bash
agentx run gmail-agent "summarize my unread emails from today"
```

For interactive mode (chat-style):

```bash
agentx run gmail-agent -i
```

## Chain Agents Together

This is the killer feature. Agents write to stdout, so you can chain them with standard Unix pipes — build multi-step AI workflows in a single line:

```bash
# Research, then write a Notion page
agentx run web-researcher --quiet "2026 AI trends" \
  | agentx run notion-agent "create a new page summarizing this"

# Scan code, then file bugs
agentx run security-scanner --quiet "audit src/auth/" \
  | agentx run linear-agent "create a bug for each finding"

# Three-step pipeline
agentx run web-researcher --quiet "React best practices" \
  | agentx run writing-assistant --quiet "rewrite as a team guide" \
  | agentx run slack-agent "post this to #frontend"
```

Use `--quiet` on intermediate agents to pipe only raw output. See [Pipes and Agent Chaining](/docs/pipes-and-chaining) for the full guide.

## Pipe Files Into Agents

You can also pipe file content directly:

```bash
cat report.csv | agentx run data-analyst "analyze this data"
```

## List Installed Agents

```bash
agentx list
```

## Update Agents

Update a specific agent:

```bash
agentx update gmail-agent
```

Update all installed agents:

```bash
agentx update --all
```

## Uninstall Agents

```bash
agentx uninstall gmail-agent
```

## Schedule an Agent

Agents with a `schedule` block in their manifest can run automatically on a cron schedule:

```bash
# Start the agent's schedule
agentx schedule start slack-agent

# View active schedules
agentx schedule list

# Check the latest run
agentx schedule logs slack-agent

# Stop the schedule
agentx schedule stop slack-agent
```

A background daemon manages all schedules. It starts automatically when you schedule your first agent and shuts down when all schedules are stopped. After a system restart, resume your schedules with:

```bash
agentx schedule resume
```
